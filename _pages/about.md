# About
Hi, welcome to my website. I am **Jiacheng Xue（薛嘉诚）**, a master student at [Xi’an Jiaotong University](https://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). I am in the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://mec.xjtu.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Lingling Wu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/lingling.wu/home).My work centers on **metamaterials**, **robot development (based on STM32 microcontrollers)**, and **online monitoring of 3D printing**.


# Research interrests

I have extensive experience in interdisciplinary projects, including leveraging [RCGAN](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0008622320306734?via%3Dihub) for inverse design of metamaterials, constructing mobile robotic systems to enable large-scale 3D printing, and training Mask-RCNN models to monitor and control 3D printers. 

During my master’s studies, I have focused on AI-based metamaterial design as my primary area of exploration, emphasizing the role of AI models in enhancing the diversity, accuracy, and efficiency of metamaterial design.
