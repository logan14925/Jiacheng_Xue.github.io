## ðŸ“„ [**Machine Learning-Based Online Monitoring and Closed-Loop Controlling for 3D Printing of Continuous Fiber-Reinforced Composites**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950431725000061)  
*Published: March 18, 2025*  
*Journal: Additive Manufacturing Frontiers*

This study addresses the challenge of ensuring consistent mechanical performance in 3D-printed continuous fiber-reinforced composites by developing a process monitoring and closed-loop feedback control strategy. A neural network with 94.70% accuracy enabled real-time flow rate recognition and control, significantly improving surface quality and mechanical propertiesâ€”up to 3â€“6Ã— enhancement in tensile strength and elastic modulus. This strategy supports remote and unmanned printing in extreme environments.

## ðŸ“„  [**Mechanical Metamaterials for Handwritten Digits Recognition**](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.202308137)  
*Published: December 25, 2023*  
*Journal: Advanced Science*

This paper presents a non-electrical mechanical neural network based on bistable kirigami-inspired metamaterials. It functions reliably in low-temperature, electricity-free environments, performing handwritten digit recognition. This innovation demonstrates the potential for mechanically driven computing as a complement to traditional electronic systems.
