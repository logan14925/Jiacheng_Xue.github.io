### [**Machine Learning-Based Online Monitoring and Closed-Loop Controlling for 3D Printing of Continuous Fiber-Reinforced Composites**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950431725000061)  
*Published: March 18, 2025*  
*Journal: Additive Manufacturing Frontiers*

This study addresses the challenge of ensuring consistent mechanical performance in 3D-printed continuous fiber-reinforced composites by developing a process monitoring and closed-loop feedback control strategy. A neural network with 94.70% accuracy enabled real-time flow rate recognition and control, significantly improving surface quality and mechanical properties—up to 3–6× enhancement in tensile strength and elastic modulus. This strategy supports remote and unmanned printing in extreme environments.
