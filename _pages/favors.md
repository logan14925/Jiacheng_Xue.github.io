# RoboMaster Experience

## About RoboMaster
[**RoboMaster**](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US), organized by DJI, is an annual robotics competition where university teams design robots to compete in challenges. It emphasizes innovation, teamwork, and technical skills in robotics, including mechanical design, electronics, and software development.


## My Journey in RoboMaster

I devoted the majority of my university years to the **DuXing** RoboMaster team, where I experienced tremendous growth both technically and personally. Many professors and friends often asked why I poured so much time and energy into something that seemed to offer little tangible return—neither financial gain nor traditional academic output. But my answer never changed: 

*"Every time I structured a mechanical system or wrote a line of control code, it felt like I was breathing life into a machine. In those moments, I wasn’t just building a robot—I was building a part of myself."*

**Only love.** 

### 2021: Sentinel Robot Chassis Design
As part of the mechanical team, I designed the chassis for the Sentinel robot, focusing on stability and maneuverability through mechanical engineering principles and structural optimization.

### 2022: Infantry Robot Chassis Design
I designed the Infantry robot chassis, prioritizing speed, durability, and adaptability to various terrains, enhancing the team's competitive performance.

## History of Our Team - **DuXing(笃行)**
I am truly honored to have spent my undergraduate years as part of the **DuXing** Robotics Team at Xi'an Jiaotong University. This remarkable team has not only provided me with invaluable friendships but also extraordinary opportunities for personal and professional growth. I sincerely hope that the **DuXing** team will continue to push boundaries, reach new heights, and achieve even greater success in the future.
