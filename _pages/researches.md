# Event Camera-based Vibration Measurement

My current master's research focuses on developing a revolutionary non-contact vibration measurement system using event cameras (Dynamic Vision Sensors). This innovative approach combines cutting-edge dynamic vision technology with advanced signal processing algorithms to enable precise vibration detection in mechanical systems.

**Key Innovations:**
- Spatio-temporal density clustering algorithm achieving 82%+ noise removal
- Novel vibration reconstruction algorithm for extracting micro-vibration components  
- Standardized methodology for 2-300Hz frequency range measurements
- Integration with robotic arm assistance for optimal signal acquisition
