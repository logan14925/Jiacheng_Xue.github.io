perma# About
Hi, welcome to my website. I am **Jie XiongÔºàÁÜäÊù∞Ôºâ**, a master student at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). I am in the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://mec.xjtu.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Xiang LiÔºàÊùéÂìçÔºâ](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/lixiang), a national-level young talent. My work centers on **Embodied Intelligence**, **Signal Processing**, and **Robotics Development**.

# Research interests

I have extensive experience in interdisciplinary robotics projects, specializing in **RoboMaster competitions** where I've led teams to multiple national championships. My expertise spans mechanical structure design, embedded software development, and fault diagnosis systems.

During my master's studies, I focus on **Dynamic Vision-based Non-contact Vibration Measurement Systems** using event cameras, combining robotics control with advanced signal processing for industrial applications.itle: ""

# Research interests

I have extensive experience in interdisciplinary projects, including leveraging [RCGAN](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0008622320306734?via%3Dihub) for inverse design of metamaterials, constructing mobile robotic systems to enable large-scale 3D printing, and training Mask-RCNN models to monitor and control 3D printers. 

During my master‚Äôs studies, I have focused on AI-based metamaterial design as my primary area of exploration, emphasizing the role of AI models in enhancing the diversity, accuracy, and efficiency of metamaterial design.
